# Myers_Briggs_Personality_Test_Application
This is a small and simple Machine Learning project. The front-end is Java (PersonalityTest) and the back-end is Python (PersonalityServer). The user uses the JavaFX Application (client) to connect to the back-end using Python Flask where a Machine Learning model is trained and it is used to predict the user's personality (out of 16 different personalty as per Myers and Briggs Personality Test) and the model predicts and returns the personality to the client's application. Before that the user gives a test of forty different general questions in the Application. Back-end is loaded in the server. Also, the client has an option to request the personality details to be sent in his/her email address with the help of Java. DecisionTreeClassifier has been used to train the model. One more thing, due to less quantity of data in the dataset. The output given by the model cannot be completely trusted.
